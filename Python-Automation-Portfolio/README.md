# Product Suitable Vehicle Tab Scraper Demonstration
## Overview
The "Product Suitable Vehicle Tab Scraper Demonstration" demonstrates a production-style Python Selenium
automation architecture used for scraping complex, dynamic web applications.

## Demonstrated Skills
- Headless browser optimization
- Parallel execution (ThreadPoolExecutor)
- Dynamic content synchronization
- Nested UI expansion strategies
- Fault-tolerant scraping architecture
- Clean, structured data output

## Confidentiality
To protect client data and proprietary logic:
- Real URLs, selectors, and JavaScript payloads are removed
- Core implementations are intentionally abstracted
- This repository is for **architecture and skill demonstration only**

Private, fully functional implementations are available for
legitimate project discussions.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Selenium
- ChromeDriver
- Concurrent Futures






# Product Cards URL Scraper Demonstration

### Project Summary
Built a production-grade web scraper "Product Cards URL Scraper Demonstration" that systematically extracts 50,000+ product listings
from a major European automotive parts e-commerce platform with complex navigation.

### Technical Challenges Solved:
1. **Multi-Level Navigation**: Handled 4-level deep category trees with dynamic loading
2. **State Management**: Maintained session across catalog/subcategory navigation
3. **Pagination Handling**: Processed 1000+ pages with AJAX-based pagination
4. **Data Consistency**: Ensured clean data extraction despite inconsistent HTML structure
5. **Error Recovery**: Implemented retry logic and state restoration on failures

### Key Technical Features:
- **Intelligent Element Detection**: Multiple fallback selectors with priority scoring
- **Memory-Efficient Processing**: Streamed data to CSV to handle large datasets
- **Professional Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and automatic screenshot capture
- **Configurable Skipping**: Category-based filtering system
- **UTF-8 Encoding**: Proper handling of international characters

### Technologies Used:
- Python, Selenium WebDriver
- CSV Data Export with UTF-8 encoding
- ChromeDriver with optimized options
- Explicit Waits and robust element location
